  <h1>Skateboarding</h1>
  <p>
    <br/>
  The bumps, bruises, and broken bones
  The blood that pours from open wounds
  The stitches needed to mend the cuts
  All of this can become too much

  The death-defying leaps of faith
  The frightening heights at which you face
  You still decide to risk your life
  Just because it all feels right

  Some people do it day and night
  Just because it's a way of life
  To have the thrill without a pill
  Skateboarding is my way of life<br/>
<br/>
