# Week 9 assignment
## Mason Birgenheier

1) since the last assignment, I am feeling a lot more comfortable with css and html working cohesively.

2) with that being said, That does not mean I went through some headache trying to make sure everything was
okay and was mapping without a problem.

3) The fonts were a pain for me, but I truly feel as if I am getting more comfortable.

4) I'm mostly still frustrated about my website not showing up... I followed week 3 'how to go live' and still not working...
