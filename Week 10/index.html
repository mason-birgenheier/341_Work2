          easier to use and more visually pleasing on a wider variety of devices could help to increase activity
          on the site.  For example, a potential customer looking at a store's site on their phone or tablet will
          probably be more likely to make a purchase on the site if it is easy for them to navitage.  If a potential
          customer is having trouble finding an item, logging in, or paying because of the device they are using,
          they are more likely to go looking on a different company's website.  Besides this, a site that is
          user friendly on any device will feel more professional to customers.</p></div>
